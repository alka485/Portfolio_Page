# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description

For this challenge I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be added to over time to become my own personal portfolio of work. I used what I have learned in the first two weeks of the bootcamp to write the HTML and CSS from scratch, while keeping in mind the following requirements:

1) Site is divided into several sections, including About Me, Work, and Contact Info.

2) I included functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections

3) I included a link to a PDF of my resume.

4) I included a recent photo of myself.

5) The page was styled for multiple screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones.

6) I also included some on hover effects for the various links and the projects on the page.
